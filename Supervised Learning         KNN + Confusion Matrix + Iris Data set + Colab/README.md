# Supervised Learning KNN + Confusion Matrix + Iris Data set + Colab


### This is an implementation of confusion matrix in Colab using ceratian data se. KNN is supervised learning (training data provides labels) and non-parametric Algorithm (there is no assumptions or defined function, it only learns from the data patterns). The documentation of the project is found at this link https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sX6M8Ujzyr5IVZ8tUwqfKJUly7LsvaeeYOA1heQB_P8/edit#slide=id.g206949ca6a4_0_344

### Environment : Colab, Tensor flow 2




### Programming Language : Python
