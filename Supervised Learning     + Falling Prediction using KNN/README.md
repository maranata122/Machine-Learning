# Supervised Learning +  Falling Prediction using KNN

### This is a Falling Prediction project using KNN. KNN is supervised learning (training data provides labels) and non-parametric Algorithm (there is no assumptions or defined function, it only learns from the data patterns). The documentation of the project is found at this link https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cs04kTKdT_OyiN0UQs22GsMhLCk8X3_BrBBpnfQw_PE/edit#slide=id.g206949ca6a4_0_5
### Environment : Colab, Tensor flow 2




### Programming Language : Python
